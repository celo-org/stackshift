# Social Connect dApp

This demo dApp is designed to help users understand how to integrate the Social Connect protocol. The features included are:

1. Assign a social identifier (in this case, I selected Twitter) to an address.
2. Retrieve the address associated with the previously mapped identifier to transfer value.
3. Delete the mapping within the protocol.

## Built With

- [Celo Composer](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer)
- [Social Connect](https://github.com/celo-org/SocialConnect)

## Notes

This dApp has been created for demonstration purposes. For a production-ready dApp, consider updating the architecture and implementing server-side functions to ensure the security of your environment variables, preventing exposure of sensitive information.
