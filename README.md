## Contributing to Stackshift

### General tips
- Before making the PR, run the code by yourself first to avoid any obvious errors and to make sure it works as expected.
- Provide pictures or screenshots to illustrate complicated processes where needed.
- Do not copy and paste existing content. Plagiarism is a serious issue and will not be tolerated. If the tutorial is inspired by some existing content (for example forking an Ethereum tutorial to convert it for use on Avalanche), reference it and link to it.
Add potential errors and troubleshooting. Of course, the tutorial shouldn't list all possible errors but make an effort to catch the important or most common ones.
- Include any walkthrough videos or video content in the PR by uploading it to Google Drive if needed.
